# World-University-Rankings

Goals: 

The problem when choosing a university is to look at the different sources to see which one is the best, 
the World University Rankings is using data about University Rankings from multiple sources, each of the sources
is using a different hierarchization system. Besides the World University Ranking systems, there are also information 
about the schools and countries, about the education expenditure, and education attainment.

Ranking universities is a difficult, political, and controversial practice. 
There are hundreds of different national and international university ranking systems, many of which disagree with each other. 
Of all the universities in the world, which are the best?


Describe the source of data:

The DataSet worked on this project was provided by The Center for World University Rankings, 
it is a leading consulting organization providing policy advice, strategic insights, and consulting 
services to governments and universities to improve educational and research outcomes.
